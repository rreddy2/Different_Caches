what doesn't work:
		Everything works, except the case of setAssociative where numSets = 2
						  and the next line prefetching when numSets = 2 as well
						  I'm not sure why they aren't working, becauese all other cases
						  are working just fine except the first one. In both cases, the 
						  numbers I get are within 5 of the correct answer
